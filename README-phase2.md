Description of phase:
added authentication and authorization, improve upon and expand the “like/remove a like” functionality to be akin to “votes”, add a text-based comment mechanism, and add a user profile to the web front ends.
missing functionality:
we have some rendering problems on the website which doesn't effect the functionality but forces the user to refresh after making posts and comments. 

Instructions on building and running each component (local and remote)
The backend is running all the time so no need start that
to start the local website you need to be inside the ideas folder and run npm start
